# gamecube-mod
Me messin' around with gamecubez

The journey so far...
[jamchamb](https://github.com/jamchamb?tab=repositories&q=ac&type=&language=&sort=) has a ton of good stuff for modding ACPL

[devkit pro](https://github.com/devkitPro/gamecube-examples) has real examples of creating .dol files (run in dolphin emu) from c or c++ using makefile

Next I should...
 - MAKE jamchamb's [ac-mod-template](https://github.com/jamchamb/ac-mod-template) and see if we can apply it as a patch to ACPL
